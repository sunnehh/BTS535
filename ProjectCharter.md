1. Introduction (mkleiman1)
   - This project aims to create an application regarding a users fitness and health status. A number of tools can be implemented for this to work, such as a template to demonstrate excercises, a meal plan, a calorie counter, a tool to track burnt calories, a method of account creation, workout creation, and a tool to easily manage your own workouts.
2. Overview (including objectives) (mkleiman1)
   - We are planning to develop our own application to facilitate fitness and health tracking. We will create this application as a team of programmers at seneca college. 
     2.1 Objectives
     -An application designed for people ages 15-65 from all over the world to be able to track and improve their overall health and fitness. This application will be up and running prior to the beginning of the winter term, with tools for tracking, creating, and implementing various different workouts all with a few pushes of some buttons.
     -Displaying the users progress and workouts to go will also be included as users begin to fill up their accounts.
3. Milestones (at least five)
   - Finalize design requirements for features to include
   - implementation of account / sign in system
   - implementation of workout tracking system
   - implementation of interactivity between accounts
   - implementation of creating relationships between individual workouts to track long-term progress
4. Deliverables (at least five)
