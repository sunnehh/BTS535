1. Introduction (mkleiman1)
   - This project aims to create an application regarding a users fitness and health status. A number of tools can be implemented for this to work, such as a template to demonstrate excercises, a meal plan, a calorie counter, a tool to track burnt calories, a method of account creation, workout creation, and a tool to easily manage your own workouts.
2. Overview (including objectives) (mkleiman1)
   - We are planning to develop our own application to facilitate fitness and health tracking. We will create this application as a team of programmers at seneca college. 
     2.1 Objectives
     -An application designed for people ages 15-65 from all over the world to be able to track and improve their overall health and fitness. This application will be up and running prior to the beginning of the winter term, with tools for tracking, creating, and implementing various different workouts all with a few pushes of some buttons.
     -Displaying the users progress and workouts to go will also be included as users begin to fill up their accounts.
3. Milestones (at least five)
   - Finalize design requirements for features to include
   - implementation of account / sign in system
   - implementation of workout tracking system
   - implementation of interactivity between accounts
   - implementation of creating relationships between individual workouts to track long-term progress
4. Deliverables (at least five)
   - Login system
   - Exercise tracker
   - Workout tracker (a workout is a session with one or more exercises with one or more repititions)
   - A user wall / profile
   - Long-term progression tracker (a view for multiple workouts)
6. Preliminary Budget (to be left empty)

8. Risks, Assumptions, and Constraints (at least three of each)

**Risks:**
- Feature Creep: The team might be tempted to add more features than initially planned, leading to delays in project completion.
- User Adoption: There could be a challenge in getting users to adopt the new fitness tracking application due to competition from well-established apps.
- Technical Issues: Integration of features like workout tracking and account systems could run into technical challenges, leading to potential delays.

**Assumptions:**
- The application will have stable internet access for users to interact with the cloud-based features, such as progress tracking and account creation.
- The development team will have access to the necessary resources and tools (e.g., development software, libraries) to implement all key features.
- Users will provide accurate personal information (e.g., weight, workout data) to track their fitness accurately.

**Constraints:**
-Time Constraint: The project needs to be completed before the winter term begins.
-Budget Constraint: The project must be developed without exceeding any financial limits (though the exact budget is to be defined later).
Resource Limitation: The team is limited to using available development tools and libraries, which may restrict certain advanced functionalities.
