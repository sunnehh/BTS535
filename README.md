### Raspberry PI application to control access to buildings

### 1 - Describe the problem;

  In many buildings, access control systems are outdated or inefficient, relying on manual verification or old-fashioned card systems. These methods can be prone to security risks such as unauthorized entry or lost access cards, and they offer limited flexibility in adjusting permissions remotely. The need for a more modern, reliable, and flexible solution that uses current technologies such as Raspberry Pi is growing to provide better security and management.

### 2 - Propose a solution;
  We propose a Raspberry Pi-based application that automates building access control. This system will use RFID technology or facial recognition to allow authorized personnel entry into the building. The Raspberry Pi will act as the core controller, managing entry and exit, tracking access logs, and sending notifications to building managers in real time. It will allow for easy integration with existing security systems, remote access management, and scalable access for multiple users.
  

### 3 - List the technologies required by the solution.
  The proposed solution will be built using several technologies. At the core of the system is a Raspberry Pi, which will serve as the central hub for controlling access and processing data. An RFID reader or facial recognition system will be employed to identify authorized individuals trying to access the building. The system logic will be implemented in Python, enabling efficient control of the hardware components and integration with other technologies. A database will be used to store user credentials and access logs, ensuring a reliable record of all entries and exits. The system will also feature a web interface to allow remote management and monitoring of access control, and it will be connected to the buildingâ€™s network via Wi-Fi or Ethernet, ensuring administrators can manage permissions and track usage remotely.
